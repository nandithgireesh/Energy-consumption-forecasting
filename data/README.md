# Dataset

Place the raw dataset file here:

```
data/raw/household_power_consumption.txt
```

## Source

- **Dataset**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository — Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
- **Direct Download**: Available from UCI or Kaggle
- **Size**: ~132 MB (2,075,259 minute-level records)

## Why it's not committed to Git

The raw dataset is excluded from version control because it is **132 MB** — too large for a GitHub repository.

**Setup steps:**
1. Download `household_power_consumption.txt`
2. Place it in this folder: `data/raw/household_power_consumption.txt`
3. Run the notebooks starting from `Day1_EDA.ipynb`
